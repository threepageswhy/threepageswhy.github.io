`I love how seeing your smile always brightens up my day
I love how we talk openly about anything and everything
I love how you laugh when I make a dumb joke that didn't even make sense
I love the way you grab my fingers to drag me places
I love when you teach me about bio things I don't understand
I love how comfortable we are with each other
I love how we talk for hours on end about nothing at all
I love watching you sing with your eyes closed like you're a Broadway star
I love how you wink at me with your mouth open like we have our own little secrets ;D
I love the way we cuddle when we watch movies together
I love the fact that you're one of the most caring people I've ever met
I love how when you're reminded of a song you just burst out singing
I love how we love the same musicals and can jam out together
I love lying together in a grassy field or on a beach and enjoying each others' company
I love how your kisses make my heart beat out of my chest
I love cuddling to share our heat when we're cold
I love how you made the leap that started us
I love being each others' best friends forever and ever
I love that your hugs are warm embraces that give me butterflies every time
I love that you're willing to try new things together
I love your elegance and how you carry yourself like a queen
I love sharing our lives with each other
I love getting minute long snaps of you serenading me
I love the way you hold me with your arms around my waist
I love when you share your favourite music with me
I love calling you when we're working to keep each other company
I love George the orangutan ;)
I love how, even though we're both always busy, we manage to make us work
